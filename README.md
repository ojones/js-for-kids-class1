>Web app to demonstrate what an algorithm is with pbj cracker sandwiches

# Javascript for kids class 1

This repo was made for classroom purposes. Because Github is amazing, kids were actually able to clone this and deploy their own algorithms. For testing, we made cracker sandwiches in real life by following the steps in our partners algorithm.

# Install

Instead of using the command line terminal, kids were taught how to edit and deploy from Github alone.

# Usage

The file that needs to be edited in order to display your very own algorithm is `src/components/steps.js`. You can replace these lines with your own steps:
```
'step1',
'step2',
'step3',
'step4',
'step5',
```

# Deploy

You can push your own steps live by: 
1. Click on "Setting" tab in your own repo
2. Scroll down to "Github Pages"
3. Select "master-branch" for Source and click "Save"

Your apps link will display in green just below the "Github Pages" heading when it is live.

# Personal Note

[This]() was the very first `create-react-app` I ever deployed. With a full time engineering job and an infant of my own, I didn't have much time to prepare for teaching a new class of kids.

I knew I wanted them to see results for themselves quickly. I thought to myself, "Why should they need to start with vanilla javascript? Nobody else does these days."

I wanted the kids to start with Github so they could be on equal footing with the best of the world.

Github Pages and `create-react-app`, along with a quick stop at the grocery store for pbj crackers, made this class a special hit. I know that learning at USC and seeing their own work live meant a lot to these kids and families.
